# Arcade Game Project

Author: Jina Chan
Created for: Udacity Front-End Nanodegree (FEND) 2018
Cloned from: https://github.com/udacity/frontend-nanodegree-arcade-game

## Description
This is a JavaScript arcade game inspired by Frogger. The player, represented by a human-like icon, must reach the water without colliding into any of the enemies (bugs).

## Running the Game
Download all files and view **index.html** in a web browser.

## Playing the Game
Use the keyboard arrow keys to move the player left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of the screen. If the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the player reaches the water, the game is won.

## Project Requirements and Instructions for Students
The project must meet this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric). Functions must be **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).
